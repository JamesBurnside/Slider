<p>We have made a sliding puzzle program, which can be played with built-in images or a user's own image at different difficulties.</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>The program allows the user to select image and difficulty, or sets the default image with a 3x3 grid.</p>

<p>The player can then move the panels into an adjacent blank space, until they have solved the puzzle, and placed each panel in the correct space. The number of pieces in the puzzle can be increased/decreased by the user, and can be solved by clicking a button if they're really stuck.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<p>An image needs to be loaded, or a completely black image will appear. The image is then split up into 9 even squares, the size of which is determined by our pre-defined window size (in this case, the squares are 300x300). These are placed on screen in a random order, with an array of values used to store whether a certain position already has a panel in or not. </p>

<p>To increase or decrease the size, the column/row count is incremented by one, and then the board is redrawn accordingly, reshuffling the pieces.</p>

<p>The user will click on the piece they wish to move. The program will check whether it is in fact next to the blank space, and if it is, moves the piece accordingly, updating the blank position too. Then, each panel's position is compared to its correct position, and if they all match, the player has won.</p>

<p>A standard file chooser is used to let the player pick their own image, and the board is redrawn with the selected file. A loaded image will be resized to 900x900 px</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The program is written in Java, and is implemented as 3 classes,
each containing a number of methods.

<ul>

<li>The main class is Play.java. This manages the layout and gameplay functionality, including handling mouse clicks, loading/splitting/drawing the images onto the screen, and checking whether the user has won.</li>

<li>One of the auxiliary classes is TopMenu.java. This handles drawing the menu and performs some validation on the file input.</li>

<li>The other class is JMyPanel.java. This extends the JPanel class, and contains co-ordinates of, the panels current row and column, the initial row and column from which it started (to retrieve the image when redrawing) and the correct column and row for checking if someone has completed the puzzle.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>We were unsure how best to automate testing of the graphical elements, so instead tested our program manually. We appreciate that this isn't the best practice. Tests were devised for the following: </p>

<ul>

	<li> On start-up, correctly asks for difficulty, selecting different difficulties works and selecting "x" sets the default difficulty of easy.</li>

	<li>Loading images works successfully, and choosing to not start with an image selects the default image if present, otherwise is simply black squares - as intended.</li>

	<li>Increase and decrease buttons function as intended and increase and decrease the difficulty by altering the board size.</li>

	<li>checkComplete (the function to check the board to see if the player was won) functions at all board sizes, and on all correct winning moves. Correctly does not go off when the player selects "View Completed".</li>

	<li>The shuffle correctly shuffles the image randomly, correctly leaving out the bottom right hand square to be the "empty square".</li>

	<li>Panels correctly move when selected, and correctly do not move if they are not supposed to.</li>

	<li>All graphics are drawn to the screen correctly.</li>

	<li>Resizing images to 900x900 px works successfully</li>

	<li>Program correctly does not go lower than the easiest difficulty (3x3) and presents a message when the user attempts to do so.</li>

	<li>Exit correctly exits the program in a safe way.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>The program is accessible through Play.java. Further enhancements would include resizing the frame size and animating the motion of the squares would also be an interesting development.</p>
